### Hi there, I'm Omar 👋

**Apprentice (Engineering) pivoting to DevOps.**

I am currently an Engineering Apprentice. While I work in physical engineering, I have realized my true passion is in software infrastructure. I am now self-studying to transition into a dedicated DevOps Apprenticeship.

-  **My Goal:** To translate my problem-solving skills from Engineering into **Cloud Infrastructure** and **Automation**.

-  **Current Learning Projects:**
  - **Python:** Refreshing my knowledge of core syntax (Loops, Variables, Functions).
  - **Home Lab:** I use video game modification as a sandbox to understand **Configuration Management** and **File Structures** You can view my documentation here: [DevOps-Configuration](https://github.com/OmarM-Devv/File-Configuration).
  - **Linux:** Learning the command line and basic fundementals
  - **Online Resources:** activley using resources such as code-academy and youtube to upskill myself further

-  **Why DevOps?**
  I discovered that the troubleshooting I do for fun is actually 'Configuration Management' on a smaller scale. Realizing that I was already managing dependencies and config files in my spare time confirmed my desire to pivot into a professional DevOps role.

*I am actively looking for a Level 4 DevOps Apprenticeship to formalize this self-study.*
