### Hi there, I'm Omar 👋

**Apprentice (Engineering) pivoting to DevOps.**

I am currently an Engineering Apprentice. While I work in physical engineering, I have realized my true passion is in software infrastructure. I am now self-studying to transition into a dedicated DevOps Apprenticeship.

- 🔭 **My Goal:** To translate my problem-solving skills from Engineering into **Cloud Infrastructure** and **Automation**.

- 🛠 **Current Learning Projects:**
  - **Python:** Refreshing my knowledge of core syntax (Loops, Variables, Functions).
  - **Home Lab:** I use video game modification as a sandbox to understand **Configuration Management** and **File Structures**.
  - **Linux:** Learning the command line and basic fundementals
  - **Online Resources:** using websites such as code-academy and youtube to upskill myself in all the areas relevant to DevOps

- ⚡ **Why DevOps?**
  I realized that "modding" games is actually just managing dependencies and editing config files. I want to take that hobbyist curiosity and apply it to professional enterprise software.

---
*I am actively looking for a Level 4 DevOps Apprenticeship to formalize this self-study.*
